I dont know hoe serious this sis suppossed to be becuase i know im not actually gonna use this so am i suppossed to treat this seriously of just write stuff th meet the word count? Becuase i can write about being the catering lead at panrera bread and how im the youngest one theyve ever had and how i make more money than eveyone there eccept for the general manage but like what good would it do when litteraly no one is gonna read this. That is literally the only job ive ever had that i just worked my way up in. Its actually meaningless though so the only good it had done me is provide me with managirirale xperiance and leadership skills, how to handle orders that cost more than i make in a year, and when to ask for help.  and i just need 500 words, so basically im just gonna upload an anthropology assignment lol. According to Farmer, the erasure of history is the single easiest way to explain structural violence. Erasure, or even the distortion of history is part of the process of desocialization necessary for the changing of historical accounts, or what happened and why. Exploring the historical roots of a problem is not a popular process because it can question history as we have been told it. Understanding the historical context does not make excuses for it, it simply explains it. Although anthropological inquiry usually starts with current events and visible problems, we must look into the past. However, when a problem is proven to exist, we must take into account possible erasures and distortion of meanings.  We must have a historically deep and geographically broad view that considers the political economy to avoid a shallow and inaccurate analysis.  Those who only consider one  method will not fully understand the “webs of living power.” Those who consider the historical links as well as the living links will have a better understanding . Accounts that are “richly socialized” take time and space, but  create a more reliable account. Simple surface level accounts are more popular and easier to understand, but do not provide a deep understanding. It can be a challenge to determine what is relevant or irrelevant, as it depends on what exactly we are looking for, and all must be considered. We must look at the whole picture, not just the surface level facts. We must understand the history and background, and even question the history we are told and find the reasons for the historical facts we are told, as in the example of the French and their 5 service meals, and how they acquired the wealth for their such activities. What does the example of the French prove? What are other examples of Erasure? The navajo people, before vs after colonization, how they incorporated western medicine and interact. Anyways that my bio, sorry if someone is actually reading this and has to read about anthropology as a computer science person <3
